Sprint 4

I was in charge of creating the first page of the website when it launched at start up. I had the best experience with using HTML and CSS on the team so we thought it would be best for me to work on it. I went in trying to just make something simple that explains the overall scope of our project. I had to inc a good color to fit with the boot strap that followed the entire theme of our project. I also wrote a quick about us section. I was also in charge of documentation and trying to find the best  boot strap to use. Being in a team of three you have to be able to work in more than one area so I am very lucky to be able to learn atleast one or two more things per sprint than most groups and their members do.

Sprint 5

My role for sprint 5 was a little different than I thought it was going to be which is exciting because I got to be involved with a completely different part of the project than I was before hand. Sprint 5 was a good way for me to be introduced to database management practices as I was the member of the team responsible for inputting the example user information data into a table I created that would allow for my team to have tickets to show on presentation day. I pulled the example names and emails from Illinois Tech’s  men’s baseball roster (I had the players give me the OK that I could use their information for our project so it is ok)

Sprint 6

I was given another database management task from our project manager and I was actually very excited about this because I think I am staring to get a hand of dat baseball management and working within SQL is becoming more comfortable for me. I was tasked with creating fake tickets for the project within the DBS. I had to fabricate tickets and make them work with the overall scope of the project. I messed up a few times with errors in syntax but lucky we were able to find exactly where they were so we could go back and correct them. 
 was also in charge of documentation once again and making sure that everybody was updating their trello cards and committing and vagranting up Being in a team of three you have to be able to work in more than one area so I am very lucky to be able to learn atleast one or two more things per sprint than most groups and their members do.
